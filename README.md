"Fun" with Typescript. Probably cursed.

At the moment it should be enough to use the `index.html` and supply your own input files.
If you want to build the ts files, make sure to replace the path variable in `src/utilitiy.ts` so that it points to your own input-folder (also the filenames are hardcoded in ts file so maybe change them too ^^).
