<h1>AOC 2023 --- Merry Christmas to all who see this </h1>

<p> 
	This is a "website" for the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">AOC</a> and also a) a logbook of how I went mad and b) something for me to easily test other people inputs after I solved the daily task.
</p>
<p>
	The code for this website and my attempts at writing Typescript can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/Aerodriver/AOC23/tree/master">git repository</a>.
</p>

<h2> Day 1</h2>
<p>
	First day of AOC, first day of trying out Typescript. 
	After getting things to run locally and wrestling with the question "are those additions or string concats that I am doing?", part 1 was easy.
	Then Part 2 put me in a temporary stasis.
	Because my initial solution was based on a regular expression I had to do some thinking.
	Now some of the words I was looking for could overlap and normally regex consumes the matches, so that overlapping numbers would not be detected.
	I resorted to using lookaheads and only match the parts that can't be part of an overlap, resulting in matches like "nin".
	While not great, it worked and Day 1 ended without me murdering someone.

<h2> Day 2 </h2>
<p>
	Second Day.
	If I find the time I will make this website work as something more than just a worse logbook; if I don't then I will just keep writing about my descent into madness induced by Typescript
	So while getting Typescript stuff to automaticly be put into here did not work out without havning to put thought into it, I decided to simply put the equivalent JavaScript as script tags in here.
	Now this html file can be used standalone without a server or whatnot.
</p>
<p>
	This day was way easier than day 1, so I got to look at how classes work (at a basic level, polymorphism might come in play in the future) and even use a custom type.
	I am still handling parsing with regex and dread the day where this won't be enough for a task.
	The first part took me the longest (the second was just "search for the max number in a game for every color") because I did not read the task right and initially used a wrong regex for parsing (did not account for double digits xD).
	So far this is more an intro to JS than an intro to TS, but we will se where the journey goes.

<h2> Day 3 </h2>
<p>
	I tried using type aliases and made many mistakes like expecting a Map to be capable of taking more than just one simple value as a key (for example a pair of two numbers).
	My first idea was to scan the lines in a very stupid way, what I came up with later is not much more intelligent but it is shorter.
	It feels like not using type aliases would have made things easier; also my python "everything has to be done functionally and on a list" mentality keeps haunting me.
	I still did not look into automatically putting the finished Javscript in here so copy and paste has to be enough.
	My biggest fear right now is that I did not see some edge case where my code would break however as it gave me the correct results, I am somewhat optimistic.
	One thing which thankfully wasn't a problem, where numbers that had two gears connect them, but I still think that my code might take a number more than once in some case.
	Scratch that last sentence the possible bug of one number being taken into account more than once for part 1, was fixed.

<h2> Day 4 </h2>
<p>
	Probably the easiest day so far. 
	If it where not for my inability to get the correct indexes in Part 2 this would have taken less time than it did.
	I also startet to add some dumb versions for things like a map or a set; they internally just use a map or set where things are stringified but with this I can use them in the future without having to think about stuff like Set(2) {[name,1], [name,1]} again.
	Only thing that gives me a headache at the moment are iterables in those dumb classes but so far it seems to work(?).

<h2> Day 5 </h2>
<p>
	We are already at the part of AOC where, if you are stupid, you better have a fast computer.
	Part 1 was somewhat easy (I like that TS can handel big numbers without me having to think about them) and part 2 was not hard but took a long time if you bruteforced it.
	I wrote some nasty code to build and concat functions based on the puzzles map which works well for part 1; for part 2 I still need to implement the smart solution that I found out when I was already finished.
	The only bigger problem I had was, that due to a mishandled check for which map to use, I mapped one more number per map than I should have, which resulted in my original code giving an answer off by one for part 2.

<br/>
<h2> Day 6 </h2>
<p> 
	Because I had not much time I coded the solvers for today on my laptop in python; thankfully the problems where not that hard.
	Part 2 can be solved much more efficient but I did not take more time than needed to bruteforce it.
	When I have a spare minute I will implement the smart solution and add it to the repo.

<br/>
<h2> Day 7 </h2>
<p> 
	I got to use enums, so at least I now know a bit about how they work in Typescript.
	I made a lot of stupid mistakes esp. during part 2 which lead to wrongly sorted lists and confusion.
	At least I did implement the smart solution for day 6, so there's that.

<br/>
<h2> Day 8 </h2>
<p> 
	The first part was easy, the second needed me to use my brain power.
	At first I tried the dumb aproach for part 2, after about 20 minutes of my programm running I stopped it and used a smarter one.
	Initially I worried about having to deal with multiple cycles per start-word, but all of them are a multiple of the navigation-instruction length so all was gucci.
	Still need to implementd day 5 part 2 in the smart way ...

<br/>
<h2> Day 9 </h2>
<p> 
	Possibly the fastest day so far, no othe hidden problems but negative numbers (so I had to use a slightly different regex than usually).
	Implementing part 2 just took one `reverse()` of a list; I am quite happy that I did not need to think more about it.
	Also I now added the scripts for day 6-9 to this site; day 5 is going to wait until I figure out what I am doing wrong.
